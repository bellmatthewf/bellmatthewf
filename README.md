# Matt Bell

Howdy! My name is Matt :wave:. I'm a Software Engineer at [PartnerStack](https://partnerstack.com/), a Toronto startup that powers partner programs for tech companies.

Unfortunately, there isn't much to see here. All of the work I've done is in private repositores.

Feel free to check out my analytics portfolio [website](https://www.matthewbellanalytics.com/) from when I was working as a data analyst :smile:
